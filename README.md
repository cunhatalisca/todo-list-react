## Automated tests

Learning to automate tests

## Technologies used ans tools:

- Mocha
- Axios
- Nock

## Run the tests:

- npx mocha test.js

## Conclusion:

- When using nock, i noticed that the tests decreased your ms (latency) in the search for the object provided by the api (since with the library you don't need to call the api directly).
